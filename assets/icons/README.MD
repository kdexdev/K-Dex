All SVG icons inside of this folder (besides the custom [app logo](./logo.svg)) have come from the [Phosphor icon pack](https://phosphoricons.com/), which falls under the MIT license.

The [app logo](./logo.svg) and its [larger version](./logo-large.svg) were made by using assets found online, without the informing of their original owners. Currently, they are only placeholder files; they are subject to change when the system is entering functional beta, and custom iconography is comissioned.
